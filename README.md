# Dice ðŸŽ²

## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial was to introduce me to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps I'll build in the future. This app taught me how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What I created

A Las Vegas dice app. I made the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!
